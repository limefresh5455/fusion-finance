                of paying certain investors compensation, subject to the
                relevant limits, if they suffer financial loss caused by an
                investment firm being unable to meet its financial obligations
                (in other words, pay everything it owes). In the event that a

                lesser of ninety per cent of your loss, which is recognised as
