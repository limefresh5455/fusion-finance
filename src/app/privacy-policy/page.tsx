                We understand that personal data is important to individuals and
                it is equally important to us. Our Privacy Notice explains what
                we use personal data for and outlines the rights of individuals
                regarding its use. Please read this document to understand how
                and why we use personal data. We use personal data to provide
                business services, comply with legal and regulatory obligations,
                and for legitimate business purposes such as advising, arranging
                transactions, setting up plans, and assisting customers with
                claims and encashments. Data is shared with relevant product
                producers to facilitate these processes. If we receive personal
                information about someone else, we must ensure we have their
                permission and inform them of our Data Privacy Notice.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">What is Personal Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Personal Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Personal data refers to data relating to a living individual who
                can be identified from the data. This includes personal details,
                family and lifestyle details, education and training, employment
                details, financial details, contractual details, and online
                identifiers like IP addresses and cookies.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Sensitive Personal Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Sensitive personal data, or special categories of personal data,
                include medical details, political opinions, religious or
                philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, data concerning
                health or sex life, sexual orientation, race, ethnic origin,
                genetic data, and biometric data. Although personal data
                relating to criminal convictions and offenses are not included
                in this category, similar extra safeguards apply to its
                processing.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Automated and Manual Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Automated Data refers to information collected or processed by a
                computer operating automatically based on given instructions.
                Manual Data refers to information recorded as part of a relevant
                filing system or intended to form part of such a system.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Privacy by Design and Default</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Privacy by Design means that any action involving personal data
                processing must consider data protection and privacy at every
                step. This includes internal projects, product development,
                software development, IT systems, and more. Privacy by Default
                means that the strictest privacy settings should apply
                automatically once a product or service is released, without
                requiring manual input from the end user. Personal data provided
                should only be retained as long as necessary to provide the
                service.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Requirements by Law</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We must have a lawful basis to collect and use personal data,
                processing it lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Individuals
                have the right to be informed about our lawful basis for
                processing their data, which must be determined before
                processing begins. Data processing should be relevant, adequate,
                and limited to what is necessary for its purpose. If the same
                purpose can be achieved without processing the data, then no
                lawful basis exists.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">
                Request to Swap the Original Purpose
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We should not change the lawful basis for processing data
                without good reason and must always consult the Compliance
                Officer. If necessary to change the lawful purpose, it may be
                possible to continue processing under the original lawful basis
                if the new purpose is compatible with the initial one, unless
                the original basis was consent.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Processing Special Category Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Processing special category data requires identifying both a
                lawful basis for general processing and an additional condition
                for processing this type of data. The lawful bases for
                processing include consent, contract, legal obligation, and
                legitimate interests. Separate conditions for processing include
                explicit consent, processing necessary for employment and social
                protection law, vital interests protection, legitimate
                activities with safeguards, data made public by the subject, and
                legal claims or judicial capacity.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Contract</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We collect and use personal data to provide a plan contract,
                including name, date of birth, contact details, bank account
                details, financial information, health details, employment
                details, and pension and salary information. This data is used
                to process applications, issue plans, provide plan information,
                customer care, service, and to inform of relevant actions.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                We use personal data to comply with laws and regulations,
                including reporting to regulators, maintaining records, internal
                reporting, quality checks, compliance controls, and audits. We
                collect personal information to comply with Anti-Money
                Laundering laws, conduct customer due diligence, and complete
                financial reviews to recommend suitable financial products.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">What is Legitimate Interest</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We use personal data for legitimate interests that benefit our
                customers, including employment data processing, fraud
                detection, financial crime prevention, network and information
                security, compliance with law enforcement, court and regulatory
                requirements, insurer relations, industry practices, financial
                modeling, and marketing.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Consent</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We require consent to collect and use personal data, explaining
                its purpose and how consent can be withdrawn. Consent must be
                informed, unambiguous, and proactive. Individuals have the right
                to withdraw consent at any time and to be forgotten. Consent
                cannot be a condition for the execution of a contract or service
                provision.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">Where do we get Personal Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We obtain personal data directly from individuals through
                contact, forms, interactions, and our website or social media
                accounts. We also receive personal data from solicitors,
                employers, regulators, and create new personal information based
                on interactions.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">To Whom do we pass Personal Data</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We pass personal data to companies that act as service providers
                under contract, processing personal information as instructed.
                Data is transferred securely and not used for other purposes. We
                also pass personal data to product producers, investment service
                providers, regulators, and third parties with recorded consent,
                all within the EU.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-bold">
                How Long do we Keep Personal Data
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                We retain personal data as long as there is a relationship with
                the individual and after, as necessary for complaints handling,
                system back-ups, and regulatory compliance. We confirm retention
                periods when individuals avail specific services.
